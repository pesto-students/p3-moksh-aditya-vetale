Given code is as below

```
function createIncrement() {
  let count = 0;
  function increment() {
    count++;
  }
  let message = `Count is ${count}`;
  function log() {
    console.log(message);
  }
  return [increment, log];
}
const [increment, log] = createIncrement();
increment();
increment();
increment();
log(); // What is logged?
```
Output for above code would be "Count is 0".

Explaination:- When function createIncrement() is called, message variable gets initialized and at that time value of count is 0. Then when function log() is called
message gets printed as "Count is 0".
